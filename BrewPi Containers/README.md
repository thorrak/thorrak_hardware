# BrewPi-ESP Containers



There are two types of container designs that I have for the BrewPi-ESP Project. You will likely need one of each:



| Container Type                                               | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ["Main" PCB Container](Main%20PCB%20Container/README.md)     | A container for the "main" PCB, relay, PSU, and other components |
| ["Sensor Board" Container](Sensor%20Board%20Container/README.md) | A container for the "sensor breakout" PCB                    |
