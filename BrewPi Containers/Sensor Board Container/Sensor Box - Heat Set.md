# Sensor Box Container - Heat Set Insert Assembly

Most of the "main" PCB designs intend for the temperature sensors to be connected via a "sensor breakout" PCB. This PCB can then be placed close to the fermenter, allowing for shorter temperature sensor cables. The box for this sensor PCB itself incorporates a zip tie which helps to reduce the strain on the temperature sensor cables themselves. While optional, this box is highly recommended. 

This design uses screws & heat set inserts to secure both the lid and the PCB to the case base. 



## Files

This case base was designed in OpenSCAD and has been rendered to an STL file for printing. The OpenSCAD source is available as well.

## Order from Tindie

If you are interested in ordering a printed case, I make the heat set version [available through Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/thorrak/brewpi-esp-sensor-breakout-case/). Cases purchased through Tindie include the required screws and inserts.



## Bill of Materials

In order to assemble this case, you will need the following in addition to the fully assembled "sensor board" PCB (including attached temperature sensors):

| Part                                                                                         | Qty Needed |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [M3 x 6mm Screws](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oEcNGqx)                                 | 7          |
| [M3 x 4.2 dia x 6mm length Heat Set Inserts](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_onNLua3)      | 7          |
| [Small Zip-tie](https://www.amazon.com/100-Piece-Multi-Purpose-Nylon-Ties/dp/B07TB7QMSH/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=small+zip+tie&qid=1591141712&sr=8-5) (optional) | 1          |

- While optional, the small zip tie is *highly* recommended as it helps reduce the stress on the temperature sensor cables



## Assembly Instructions

Assembly for the case is fairly straightforward:

1. Insert the heat set inserts into the case using a soldering iron or heat set tool

2. Insert the zip tie through the two anchors near the hole in the back of the case (leave open - do not secure)

3. Insert the PCB into the case

4. Attach the PCB to the case base using 3 of the M3 x 6 screws

5. Pass the temperature sensor cables through the hole in the back of the case, between the sides of the zip tie

6. Secure and tighten the zip tie to secure the cables to the case

5. Place the lid on the case base and secure using the remaining M3 x 6 screws
