# Sensor Box Container

Most of the "main" PCB designs intend for the temperature sensors to be connected via a "sensor breakout" PCB. This PCB can then be placed close to the fermenter, allowing for shorter temperature sensor cables. The box for this sensor PCB itself incorporates a zip tie which helps to reduce the strain on the temperature sensor cables themselves. While optional, this box is highly recommended. 

There is currently only one sensor box design. The box comes in two parts - a base and a lid.



## Files

This case base was designed in OpenSCAD and has been rendered to an STL file for printing. The OpenSCAD source is available as well.

## Order from Tindie

If you are interested in ordering a printed case, I make them [available through Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/thorrak/brewpi-esp-sensor-breakout-case/). These cases include the screws/nuts required as noted below.



## Bill of Materials

In order to assemble this case, you will need the following in addition to the fully assembled "sensor board" PCB (including attached temperature sensors):

| [Small Zip-tie](https://www.amazon.com/100-Piece-Multi-Purpose-Nylon-Ties/dp/B07TB7QMSH/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=small+zip+tie&qid=1591141712&sr=8-5) (optional) | 1          |

- The M3 x 12mm screws and square M3 nuts are **required** for assembling this case
- These same M3 x 12mm screws and square nuts can be used for securing the PCB as well. You don't need to use two sets of screws/nuts.
- While optional, the small zip tie is *highly* recommended as it helps reduce the stress on the temperature sensor cables



## Assembly Instructions

Assembly for the case is fairly straightforward:

1. Insert the PCB into the case

2. Attach the PCB to the case base using the 3x M3 Screws/Nuts

3. Pass the temperature sensor cables through the hole in the back of the case

4. Thread the zip tie down through the hole in one side of the back of the case, through the channel underneath the base case, and back up through the hole in the other side. Wrap the zip tie around the temperature sensor cables, and zip to secure the cables to the base of the case (see below)

5. Insert the lid into the case, inserting the tabs into the holes in the case base

6. Insert the square nuts into the holes in the back of the case base

7. Secure the lid to the case base by screwing the M3 x 12 screws through the lid and into the square nuts inserted in the case

   

**Note** - depending on your display, the LCD may not be flush against the lid. You can either add additional nuts between the lid & display on the side that is closest as spacers in order to help "even" it out, or ignore it.
