# US Outlet Case Base for the ESP32 "All-in-One" PCB

This is the case design I use for all of my builds involving the ESP32 "all-in-one" PCB. It incorporates a 
standard [US duplex outlet](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-Residential-Grade-Grounding-Duplex-Outlet-White-R52-05320-00W/202066670) and [IEC-320 C14](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32815198325.html) power inlet.
