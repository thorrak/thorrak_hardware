# US Outlet Case Base

This is the case design I use for all of my builds. It incorporates a standard [US duplex outlet](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-Residential-Grade-Grounding-Duplex-Outlet-White-R52-05320-00W/202066670) and [IEC-320 C14](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32815198325.html) power inlet.



## Files

This case base was designed in OpenSCAD and has been rendered to an STL file for printing. The OpenSCAD source is available as well.

## Bill of Materials

In order to assemble this case, you will need the following in addition to the fully assembled "main" controller PCB & common components:

| Part                                                         | Qty Needed |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Screws                                                       | 13         |
| Nuts                                                         | 13         |
| Rubber Feet (Optional)                                       | 4          |
| [US Duplex Outlet](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-Residential-Grade-Grounding-Duplex-Outlet-White-R52-05320-00W/202066670) | 1          |
| [IEC-320 C14](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32815198325.html) | 1          |
| Wire                                                         | *          |
| Wire Nuts/Terminal Blocks                                    | *          |
| Wire Crimp Ends (Optional)                                   | 3          |

- Also needed (not listed) is one of the two screws that typically comes attached to the top/bottom of the US Duplex Outlet
- The rubber feet, while not required, are highly recommended to prevent the screw heads from resting on the ground
- The optional wire crimp ends are used to easily connect wires to the IEC-320 C14 power inlet
- For all of these components, please keep in mind that you will be powering devices that can pull several amps of current. Be certain to select the appropriate gauge of wire for your build.
