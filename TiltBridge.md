# Hardware for TiltBridge

The [TiltBridge](http://www.tiltbridge.com/) is a single component Bluetooth-to-WiFi bridge for the Tilt Hydrometer. Push your Tilt's data to the cloud without the need for a dedicated phone, laptop, or Raspberry Pi. TiltBridge is compatible with a number of endpoints, including Fermentrack, Brewfather, Brewers Friend, Google Sheets, MQTT, and more. 

More information on the project can be found at the [TiltBridge website](https://www.tiltbridge.com/) or in the [TiltBridge GitHub repo](https://github.com/thorrak/tiltbridge/). 

Due to its nature as a "single component" project, the BOM is simple, and there is no need for any custom PCB designs - so long as the correct ESP32 controller board is selected. There are custom case designs available depending on your board selection.




## Selecting a Controller

Information on selecting a controller can be found in the [TiltBridge documentation](https://tiltbridge.readthedocs.io/en/master/hardware.html)



## Case Designs

Depending on which PCB you selected above, there are several case designs which are currently available.
