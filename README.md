# Thorrak's Hardware Designs
This repo is a collection of PCBs and other hardware designs I've made for various projects I've released. More information can be found on pages for each of the projects themselves.

**Note** - While the majority of the hardware for my projects is contained in this repo, the software is broken out into individual projects on GitHub. Most firmware can be flashed using [BrewFlasher](http://www.brewflasher.com/).



## BrewPi-ESP

The BrewPi-ESP project reimplements the BrewPi firmware on an ESP8266, ESP32, and ESP32-S2.
