# Other Useful PCBs

This is a collection of PCBs that don't neatly fit into one of the other categories, but which I've found useful at various points. 


## BrewPi-ESP Test Boards

These PCBs are designed to allow easy testing of various BrewPi-ESP builds. The boards feature things such as on-board OneWire temperature sensors and LEDs to help easily test that releases of the BrewPi-ESP firmware work as intended.

## Jack Breakouts

These are two breakout boards which are designed to allow easy connection of an RJ-11 or RJ-45 jack to a breadboard for prototyping
