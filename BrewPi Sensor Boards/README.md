BrewPi Sensor Boards
====================

The BrewPi sensor boards are intended to allow for the DS18b20 temperature sensors (and optionally, door switch) to be connected to a PCB that is away from your main BrewPi controller, thereby allowing for the use of shorter temperature sensor cables - or for the placement of the sensor breakout inside your fermentation chamber if necessary. The sensor boards are then intended to be connected to the main controller board through the use of a cable.

There are two versions of the board, RJ-11 and RJ-45 -- however the RJ-45 version is recommended in nearly 100% of cases.
