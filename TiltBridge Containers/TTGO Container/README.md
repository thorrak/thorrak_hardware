# TTGO TFT "USB-C" Container


The TTGO TFT board with USB-C container puts a full-color TFT screen on a board with a similar footprint to the Heltec-style board. The board uses a USB-C plug for power/flashing. 

This container design secures the PCB in place through the use of printed standoffs, has printed buttons on the face of the case for toggling the reset functions, and secures the lid to the base through the use of three screws. 

This case was designed by @gromitdj on the Homebrewtalk forums at the urging of @lbussy on the same. Lbussy posted the case to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4736617/files) after the design was made available.
