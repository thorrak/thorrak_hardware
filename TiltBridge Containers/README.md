# BrewPi-ESP Containers

Although strictly optional, a 3D printed container can help make your TiltBridge build both more robust and look cleaner. 


| Container Type                                                 | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [D32 Pro Container](D32%20Pro%20Container/README.md)           | Supports the LoLin D32 Pro & matching TFT screen/cable    |
| [TTGO/Heltec Container](TTGO%20Container/README.md)            | Supports "Heltec" or "TTGO" style OLED boards             |
| [Generic OLED Container](Generic%20OLED%20Container/README.md) | Supports a common generic OLED board style (see below)    |

## Determining the Container You Need

The case you will need for your build depends on the hardware you are using. Double check that the hardware you have matches the descriptions below to ensure that you select/print the right case for your build.



### D32 Pro

The D32 Pro is a specific board offered by LoLin which has a special connector for an LCD connector in the middle of the board. These boards are designed to be paired with the specific TFT and TFT Cable also ofered by LoLin. 



### TTGO / Heltec

The TTGO or Heltec style board is becoming increasingly popular, and tends to have a higher build quality than other OLED boards (especially if purchased directly from Heltec). These boards have the OLED screen mounted to a plastic plate on the front of the board, which is secured to the back of the board with four screws. 



### Generic OLED

The "Generic OLED" container was designed for a specific, previously common generic OLED board where the OLED is not mounted to a plate but is simply "taped" to a blank space on the PCB. These boards generally have different length rows of pin headers, with the longer row having 16 pins and the shorter row 10.


NOTE: Due to the variable build quality of these boards, these are NOT recommended for new builds unless they're all you have available
