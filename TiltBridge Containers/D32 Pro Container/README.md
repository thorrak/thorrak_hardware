# D32 Pro Container


The D32 Pro is a specific board offered by LoLin which has a special connector for an LCD connector in the middle of the board. These boards are designed to be paired with the specific TFT and TFT Cable also ofered by LoLin. 

This is the recommended hardware for new TiltBrige builds, as the build quality is quite high. Unfortunately, parts are not always readily available from the manufacturer. 



## Case Design Files

This case was designed by @gromitdj on the HomeBrewTalk forums, whose talents far outstrip my own, and who I cannot thank enough.

### Case Design Note

LoLin has released two versions of the TFT - v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 - which can be distinguished by reading the silk screen printed on the front of the TFT screen. You will need to print the case design that corresponds to the version of your TFT, or the "cut out" for the screen in the case lid will not properly align with your screen.



## Bill of Materials

- 1x D32 Pro
- 1x LoLin TFT Cable
- 1x LoLin TFT
- 5x M2 x 5mm COUNTERSUNK bolts

Although M2 x 5mm countersunk bolts can be used for everything, 3x of the bolts can be replaced by  M2 x 5mm pan head if desired. 


## Assembly Instructions

#. Print the case and lid
#. Insert the D32 Pro into the case base with the USB port facing the hole on the side, and align with the screw holes in the base of the case
#. Use the 3x M2x5 pan head bolts (or 3x of the countersunk bolts) to secure the D32 Pro to the base of the ase
#. Connect the TFT to the TFT cable, and connect the TFT cable to the D32 Pro
#. Insert the TFT into the case base by aligning the holes on the TFT with the "pins" printed in the case base. Be careful when inserting the TFT not to damage the cable/connectors - you may need to twist the cable several times to get it to fit inside the case. 
#. Align the case lid with the case base and insert, ensuring the screw holes printed in the tabs on the sides of the case lid align with the screw holes printed in the case base
#. Secure the case lid to the case base by screwing the 2x M2 x 5mm countersunk bolts through the screw holes on the left and right side of the case
